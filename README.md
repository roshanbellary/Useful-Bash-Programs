 Some useful bash programs that I made to automate useful tasks

 Current List:

1. BuildC
    i.Description: A useful bash program that builds your c++ program and keeps the executable
    ii.Input: program name excluding .cpp end(ie if you wanted to build a program called helloworld.cpp, you would run "runc helloworld")
    iii.Output: standard output from executed program and errors if during build time an error was thrown
2. RunC
    i.Description: A bash program for Macs that runs a c++ program then deletes the created executable
    ii.Input: program name excluding .cpp end(ie if you wanted to execute a program called helloworld.cpp, you would run "runc helloworld")
    iii.Output: standard output from executed program and also errors if program fails to execute
3. Tree
    i.Description: A useful bash program that does what the Windows tree command does - prints out the enclosed directories and files within your current directory in a tree format
